# Planit-Technical-Assessment-Automation
For the automation was used Pyhton + Selenium

For running the testcases please install Python. In my case I was using 3.10.5
Also please create virtual environment "python.exe -m venv [PATH_TO_DIR]"
After creating the venv please activate it
Install Selenium: pip install selenium

To run test please run this line in the project root folder: python -m unittest TC1.py TC2.py TC3.py TC4.py
